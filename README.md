# Java OOP Course's Project - SIMS implementation

This project was written in 2016 as a group project work.

# It includes:
* Admin authorization.
* Manipulating with students and their data.
* Manipulating with lessons and attaching/detaching from students and teacher.
* GPA calculator based on students' grades.

# Additional info:
Project's data structure based only on arrays, there is no database, such sqlLite. At the first launch of the program it will fill students list with few students and their predefined lessons. You can easily add new students, lessons and teacher, however they all will be gone after closing the app. The general purpose of the project is to provide functionality of creating and manipulating data within one session, but not collecting data for further usage!
